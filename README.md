## My Process

### Built With
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for improved readability and accessibility.
- **CSS**:
  - Flexbox for responsive and flexible layouts.
  - Media queries to ensure mobile-first responsiveness.
  - Custom properties for maintainable and reusable styling.
- **Mobile-first Approach**: Designed for small screens first and progressively enhanced for larger devices.

### What I Learned
This project taught me:
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Prioritizing small screens first made the layout cleaner and easier to scale up.
2. **CSS Variables**: Using variables for colors, typography, and spacing simplified adjustments and ensured consistency.
3. **Accessibility**: Adding ARIA labels, focus-visible styles, and semantic HTML improved usability for all users.

### Continued Development
Moving forward, I want to focus on:
- **Desktop Design Enhancements**: Further refining the layout for larger screens.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Using screen readers and accessibility tools to identify and fix potential issues.
- **Interactivity**: Adding subtle animations or hover effects to enhance the user experience.
